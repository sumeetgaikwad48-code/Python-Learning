#nester loops = A loop within another loop (outer, inner)
#               outer loop:
#                   inner loop:   ---> (given tap here)

for x in range(3): #this will repeat for loop inside it.
    for y in range(1, 10):
        print(y, end=" ") #---> it helps to align the for loop with symbols too.
    print() #---> it will print on new line.
