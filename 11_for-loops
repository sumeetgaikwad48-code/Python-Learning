# for loops = execute a block of code a fixed number of times
#             you can iterate over a range, string, sequence etc.

credit_card = "1234-5678-9012-3456"
for x in credit_card:
    print(x)
print("Happy New Year")


#reversed is used for reverse the function.
#if you third number in for loop like ex: (1, 11, 2)<--- this number will skip number like ex: "1,3,5,7,9".
#you can use for loops for strings also.

for x in range(1, 31):
    if x == 13: #This will skip number 13 by using continue function
        continue
    else:
        print(x)
