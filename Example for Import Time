import time
my_time = int(input("Enter the time: "))
for x in range(my_time, 0 , -1):  #changing positions of time and users time and adding negative 1 can reverse this too.
    seconds = x % 60
    minutes = int(x / 60) % 60
    hours = int(x / 3600)
    print(f"{hours:02}:{minutes:02}:{seconds:02}")
    time.sleep(1)

print("TIME'S UP")

#seconds, minutes and hours formulas are to found the remaining time left like if 1 hour finished then how many minutes will left it will show you then same with seconds
